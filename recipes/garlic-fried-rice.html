    <p class="middletext">Fried rice recipe to accompany chicken adobo.<em> -sourced from seriouseats.com</em></p>
    <p>Ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon (75ml) canola oil or other neutral oil</li>
      <li>8 garlic cloves, crushed and sliced thinly
      <li>4 cups cooked white rice (24 ounces; 700g), preferably long grain, but any variety will do
    </ul>
    <p>Directions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>In a small sauce pain, heat oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until garlic softens, becomes very aromatic, and turns lightly golden, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Strain oil through a fine-mesh strainer directly into a wok; reserve cooked garlic and set aside</li>
      <li>Heat wok over high heat until oil is shimmering. Add rice, breaking up large clumps with a spatula and tossing to coat with garlic-flavored oil. Cook, stirring and tossing frequently, until no clumps of rice remain and rice is warmed through, about 4 minutes. Add reserved garlic to rice and toss to combine. Serve immediately.</li>
